# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview
* For this project we utilize Mapbox API in order to map the most recent earthquake data in relation to the Earth's tectonic plates locations. 

## Resources
* Mapbox API, D3, Leaflet, JSON, JavaScript

## Results
* After mapping this weeks data, which was pulled from the USGS, we end up with an interactive map which displays all the earthquakes and mapped techtonic plates. The markers on the map are color coordinated and sized relative to the magnitude of the quake. Once a marker is selected, the magnitude and location data appears in a popup. A legend is also present to allow the user to determine the magnitude of the earthquake based on color. This map is pannable and zoomable as well.
